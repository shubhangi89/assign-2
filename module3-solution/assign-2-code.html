                Italian food is one of the few global cuisines that Indians are truly obsessed with. 
                Italian food regularly features on the dining tables of most urban Indian households, and more often than not, 
                we fall back on pastas, pizzas and risottos to satisfy our cravings for a good meal. There are so many varieties to 
                choose among Italian dishes in veg or non-veg, from when it comes to pasta - penne, lasagne, spaghetti, macaroni, 
                tagliatelle and ravioli among others - that you can toss them in numerous sauces, herbs, vegetables and meats and 
                enjoy a hearty meal. Home-made pizzas are also a favourite option for a quick meal during game nights or family 
                get-togethers.George Miller had rightly said, "The trouble with eating Italian food is that two or three days 
                later you're hungry again".

            <p class="dummy2">You may have travelled all across the world trying all sorts of cuisines, but when you need your comfort food, that's when you realise that there's nothing quite like Indian food. The aromatic curries, masala-packed fries, biryani and parathas, they work miraculously to lure you into their spell. So prepare yourself to dive into a world of spice-packed, flavour and fragrance rich Indian food. From paneer makhni to Kerala-styled prawns, from mutton roganjosh to Parsi eggs, every dish is an exceptional mix of spunky ingredients and different cooking techniques.

                India's regional and cultural diversity reflects beautifully in its food and is possibly the main reason why Indian food outranks that of other countries. Each Indian state has its own unique pandora of flavours and ingredients.</p>

            <p class="section-heading text-center">Korean</p>
            <p class="dummy3">Korean cuisine is the customary cooking traditions and practices of the culinary arts of Korea. Korean cuisine has evolved through centuries of social and political change. Originating from ancient agricultural and nomadic traditions in Korea and southern Manchuria, Korean cuisine has evolved through a complex interaction of the natural environment and different cultural trends.[1][2]

                Korean cuisine is largely based on rice, vegetables, and (at least in the South) meats. Traditional Korean meals are named for the number of side dishes (반찬; 飯饌; banchan) that accompany steam-cooked short-grain rice. Kimchi is served at nearly every meal. Commonly used ingredients include sesame oil, doenjang (fermented bean paste), soy sauce, salt, garlic, ginger, gochugaru (pepper flakes), gochujang (fermented red chili paste) and napa cabbage.</p>
